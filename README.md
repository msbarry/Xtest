Xtest

![Xtest Demo](https://github.com/msbarry/Xtest/wiki/wiki_images/demo.png)

Xtest is a unit testing domain-specific-language implemented in [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) that extends [Xbase](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/#xbase).

The Xtest plugin for Eclipse lets you write ".xtest" files directly in an Eclipse project that are run dynamically as you change them.  Test failures and exceptions thrown are highlighted in the file as errors.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/msbarry/Xtest/wiki) for documentation and installation instructions.

Xtest follows a modified version of the branching strategy described [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), except that development occurs in the 'master' branch and every commit to the 'release' branch is considered a new Xtest release.
