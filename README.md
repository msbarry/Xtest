Xtest
=====

![Xtest Demo](demo.png)

Xtest is a unit testing domain-specific-language implemented in [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) that extends [Xbase](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/#xbase).

The Xtest plugin for Eclipse lets you write ".xtest" files directly in an Eclipse project that are run dynamically as you change them.  Test failures and exceptions thrown are highlighted in the file as errors.

Xtest interacts with any Java classes and can seamlessly test them.  Any time you save changes to a Java class that breaks a test or causes an exception to be thrown in a .xtest file, that xtest file shows up as an error in Eclipse's Package Explorer.

The [Xbase syntax](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/Xbase%20Language%20Specification.pdf) is similar to, although not exactly like Java.  This means that you must learn a slightly different language to use Xtest in your project, but it also opens the door for some interesting features since we are not limited by Java syntax.

Xtest is currently in very early stages of development and only the source code is available.  The source code can be imported as Eclipse projects provided that you have installed Xtext 2.2.  Right click on org.xtest plugin in Eclipse and select Run As->Eclipse Application. In the Eclipse instance that starts up, add Xtend libraries to your project and then create a ".xtest" file and start writing tests.

Report any bugs found on the [issues](https://github.com/msbarry/Xtest/issues) page along with a copy of the .xtest file and any referenced java classes that cause the bug.
